Installation Instructions:

1) The App was created using MatLab but you don't need to have the MatLab software on your computer. 

However, you do need to download and install a free MatLab interpreter called MatLab RunTime (MyAppInstaller_web.exe) that you can find in the main directory. 
MatLab RunTime is needed to run MatLab executables. 
Read the readme.txt file for further instructions.  

2) Download and install the AlphaHubTraderA.exe executable file. 
3) Put in the same folder the AlphaHubTraderA.exe, the splash.png and icon.ico files.
4) Create a shortcut after installation so you can launch the Trader easily. 
5) IMPORTANT: Create a folder in the C:/ directory called DataAlphaHubReader (the name needs to be exact). Download and move the file 
OPT1_C.xlsx in that folder (you can find the file among the list of files in the main page). 
6) You can watch videos discussing the trading algorithm in more details and the Alphahub platform starting with this video:

Setting up Server to Run the Trader app:

You don't need a server to run the app, you can do this on your computer. But renting a free server with a window OS is ideal because you don't have to worry for power outage and other problems with yur computer. 
You can download the app on the server and use a remote desktop application to check once in a while on the Trader. 

1) Read the detailed document How to set up a free AWS server to run the Trader (Optional).pdf in the main download page. 

Note for Mac Users, you need to get a microsoft Remote Desktop for the mac, here is the link:

After first linking with the server you can dowload other remote desktop software if you prefer.
